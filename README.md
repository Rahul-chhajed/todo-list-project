# To-Do List Project

## Description
This is a simple **To-Do List** application that allows users to add and delete tasks. You can create new to-do lists by adding **/todolist-name** in the URL of the main page. The application automatically converts the entered to-do list name into the correct format, regardless of the casing used. 

I am still working on enabling the functionality to access different to-do lists directly from the home page.

- **Auto-formatting List Name:** The app automatically converts the to-do list name to the correct format (proper case) regardless of the userâ€™s input casing.

3. **Delete Tasks:** Click the delete icon next to a task to remove it.
4. **Work in Progress:** The home page access functionality is under development, so currently, you can only access your to-do list by typing the list name in the URL.
